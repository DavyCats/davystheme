# This is the main page.

Here we can do things like making lists:

- A
  - sub
    - sub
- list
- of
- stuff

1. This
   1. one
      - is
      - partially
2. ordered!

*And **formatting*** `some` ~~text~~.

## Or Have headers

> With a quoteblock below it.

```python
for x in "Or some formatted code!":
    print(f"{x.lower()}")
```

Maybe we might even add a table.

| Like | This | one |
|:-|:-:|-:|
| *A* | **B** | ***C*** |
| 1 | `2` | 3 |

We could also put a really,  very - one might even say: extremely - long line here, just to see what happens... See, since this is in a codeblock/verbatim section, it should scroll horizontally once it gets too long for the screen to be able to display it. I wonder if this is long enough yet... Some people have these really wide monitors, so they might still be able to fit all this in.
